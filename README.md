# YT Downloader

This little application's goal is to download a YouTube file in either video or audio format, depending on the user's preference.

The program is still in its early stages because some of its functionalities are buggy or haven't been created yet.

The application can now be run from a terminal and allows to download mp4 files in both video and audio formats.

## To be developed:

- synced progress meter;
- output path hardcoded to a desktop;
- mp3 audio file conversion;
- prompt when no choice is selected;
- exe application format;
- anything else that comes to mind as to how to improve and keep this app straightforward.
